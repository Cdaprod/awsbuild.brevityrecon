# Brevity In Motion - Automated Cloud Recon Ecosystem

## Introduction
This is the initial release of the code powering a cloud-based automated recon ecosystem.

There is detailed information surrounding this repository at: https://www.brevityinmotion.com/automated-cloud-based-recon/

Not all of the codified infrastructure is complete and will be added to this repository in the future as a usable deployment package. There are some dependencies missing like IAM roles and S3 buckets that would need to be implemented for the code to run without error. However, there is a vast number of examples and templates that can be leveraged for building your own environments.

Additional documentation will be developed in the near future.
